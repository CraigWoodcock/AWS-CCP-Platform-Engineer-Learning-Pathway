# Batch

## What is Batch?

  - Fully managed batch processing service at any scale
  - Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on AWS
  - A 'batch job' is a job with a start and an end time
  - Batch will dynamically launch EC2 or Spot Instances
  - AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute/memory
  - you schedule jobs to run at a certain time and AWS Batch does the rest.
  - Batch jobs are defined as Docker images and run on ECS
  - Good for cost optimization.
